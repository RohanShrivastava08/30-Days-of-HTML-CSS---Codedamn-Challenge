Tooltip Challenge

In this lab, you would have to build a tooltip by just using HTML & CSS,
without the user any external libraries.
The tooltip would be visible when hovered over a button and then disappear when the button is not hovered anymore.

Challenges:
Create a simple #button button element in HTML
When the hover on the #button is triggered there should be a small tooltip below the button indicating that it is a tooltip
[Extra] Try and create a small triangle for the tooltip, to resemble to an actual mobile tooltip
